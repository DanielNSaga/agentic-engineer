Agentic Engineer Policy Capsule
=========================================

This capsule captures repository-level policies enforced by the
pipeline. Violations are surfaced as structured CPC findings (CFG001,
LAY001) and must be resolved before code changes move forward.

CFG001 — Configuration Completeness
-----------------------------------
- `config.yaml` MUST define: `project`, `iteration`, `policy`, and `paths`.
- The file must remain valid YAML and be readable with UTF-8 encoding.

LAY001 — Repository Layout (optional)
-------------------------------------
- Enabled when `policy.enforce_layout` is truthy.
- Required directories: `src/`, `src/ae/policy/`, `src/ae/tools/`, `tests/`.
- `policy.capsule_path` MUST exist and contain non-empty text guidance.

Runtime Validation Focus
------------------------
- The agent prioritises Python runtime errors and failing tests when deciding
  whether to apply fixes.
- Additional static gates can be configured via `policy.static_checks` in
  `config.yaml`, but none are enabled by default.

Coverage Map Scaffold
---------------------
- Coverage snapshots record the mapping between test nodeids and source
  files under `ae.tools.coverage_map.CoverageMap`.
- Data is persisted as JSON with sorted paths to keep diffs deterministic.
